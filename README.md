<h1 align="center" id="title">Kanban Board Application</h1>

<p id="description">This project is a Kanban Board application developed using the MERN stack featuring JWT-based authentication for secure login and registration. The user interface is designed with Styled Components to provide a clean and responsive experience. The application allows users to dynamically create rename and delete columns on the board. Tasks can be added edited and removed with real-time updates reflected across the board. The drag-and-drop functionality enables seamless movement of tasks between columns to update their status. Additionally tasks can be assigned to users with assigned user names or avatars displayed on the task cards for easy identification. The application ensures an efficient and intuitive workflow management system for users.</p>
